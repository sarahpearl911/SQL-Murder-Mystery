# SQL Murder Mystery

ðŸ”ŽðŸ”ŽðŸ”Ž

I solved the [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) in May 2022. I had started learning Python and became absorbed in it for a while, so this murder mystery game was the perfect refresher for me to switch gears back to SQL! Prior to starting solving the mystery, I was concerned that I wouldn't remember much of the SQL I'd learned, but it all came back to me immediately and I was able to solve the mystery with ease! 

## The Mystery

There was a murder in SQL City on January 15, 2018. I was given the below schema to have an understanding of the tables I'll be working with and how they all relate to one another.

The crime scene report had gone missing, so looking that up was the first step in finding out who committed the crime. From there, I was able to use clues from the crime scene report to query the database and eventually solve the mystery! 

## Reflection

Solving the mystery helped me feel so much more confident in my SQL abilities. Prior to starting, I was worried that I didn't have enough knowledge to complete the game. But after completing it without any trouble, I felt like I was much more mentally ready to jump back into my SQL learning! 

The only thing I would change about how I completed this challenge would be that I wish I thought to give table names aliases. Some of the tables have long names and it would have been a huge timesaver if I would have thought to alias them while I was solving the mystery.

Overall, I really enjoyed this exercise and would love to find another similar SQL game that combines fun with learning in such an effective way!
